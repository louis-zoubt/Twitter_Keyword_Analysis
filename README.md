# Twitter_Keyword_Analysis
A Project to fetch and analyze tweets based on self-selected keywords
As social media platforms turn into the major outlet for people to express sentiments, it has become increasingly vital for companies and organizations to gather and analyze social media data for growth and audience engagement. For this project, we would like to explore the current key interests and attitudes towards the University of Southern California, from users on one of the most popular social media platforms, Twitter.
With Python, we were able to collect ten thousand recent tweets that contain the keyword USC. The tweets are preliminarily analyzed to locate the key indicators, such as the top 10 most popular hashtags. We then transformed the most common words that appeared in these tweets into WordCloud to provide a more powerful visual representation. Based on the results from the preliminary analysis, we calculated the polarity and subjectivity scores for the collected tweets, reflecting the online sentiment towards our keyword.
